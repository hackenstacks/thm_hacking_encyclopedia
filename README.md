# THM Hacking Encyclopedia

## What is this?
This is a PDF that has originally been made to regroup all resources published by THM on their Advent of Cyber that has taken place through December 2019.
The resources made available were huge and they are quality content. I thought they would deserve a well formated and compact document.
At first I wanted to make it for myself to go over when I had a doubt, and I figured it could be handy to a lot of people out there.

## The PDF is fat, it's hard to naviguate through it
If you download it, you should be able to naviguate through it by clicking the titles in the SUMMARY, and you should also be able to show/hide each day by clicking the arrow next to each title.

## Why make a repo?
1. To make sharing easier.
2. To allow people making suggestions/corrections. (using issues)

## How can I help make this better?
I would be more than happy to get suggestions or corrections. (no, I have not read carefully the whole thing over and over, plus I am not a native english speaker)
I have probably made mistakes while formatting the doc, or forgot to correct some typos from the original resources.
Please, if you feel like it feel more than welcome to help!

## Can I contact the creator of the doc or the THM community and staff?
Sure thing!
